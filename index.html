This skill will enable me to effectively track my work by using proper version controls and ensuring that all of my work is saved properly on our capstone project repository.</p>

    <p>Acquiring this new skill contributes significantly to my lifelong learning journey. Lifelong learning is essential because it is important to continue learning as we grow in our professional careers as technology changes at such a rapid pace.</p>

    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Reflecting on Challenges and What I Enjoyed</h2>
    <p>While learning GitHub for Professionals, I encountered several challenges, including a very convoluted system of doing version control and not understanding some of the topics because I had not used them or worked with them before. I enjoyed the process of learning this new skill because I was able to see different perspectives on the techniques and how branching strategies differed. A lot of the information I consumed was generally the same, but it was interesting to see how even professionals use GitHub in different ways.</p>
